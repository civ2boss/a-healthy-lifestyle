This was based on the example my health finder request which searches for personalized information based on age, sex, and pregnancy status. I used Material UI for styling the form, because it was a quick way to make it look nicer. I used the react testing library for testing because I've used it previously and I like how lightweight it is. There is a bug with it for React 16.8 so I used a temp fix hack in the test.
